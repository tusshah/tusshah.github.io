title: 'Thinking About Vibe'
description: 'Highly opinionated thoroughly uniformed thoughts on development in brave new world'

There have been a number of hype cycles from EJB/XML behemoth to JS framework inundation via some sprinkling of cloud dust in my time employed in the enterprise/line of business tech industry.Like most I am guilty of irrationally cheer leading few of these while a curmudgeon for others where the truth for most was always somewhere in the middle. Vibe coding and agents is the latest kid on the block with every one talking or alteast meta talking about it. I have been playing with it on and off for last few weeks and listening/reading to folks from the industry to get a first hand feel of what the the technology is about.I thought will write down my initial reactions.Part as I would like to centralize my thoughts and part for way to get vetting and feedback.

## Tooling is Dead, Long live tooling 

   The debate between Co-pilot and agents look like will get settled in favour of both with agents being the transformative tech while the co-pilots an important progress in a more localized development context in the short term.
   
   The short terms consequences is the adoption of higher level of abstraction and ambiguity while programming where the models and associated technology transform it into more deterministic description for execution. An average approximation of looking at it similar to productivity improvements with advent of compilers or SQL[^1].An immediate springboard for 'Vibe Coding'
   
Listening to various product folks representing agent companies talk about agents in the larger trade press and podcast, it paints a very different picture of a long term future when viewed from the lense of immediate past. They point to a world where there is a wholesale disruption of enterprise[^2].Including the very definition what will it mean to be a line of business programmer atleast. 

I certainly don't think anyone should be working on generating comments for git commits if the future belongs to agentic coding in a non Visual Studio Code existence or improving the variable names for human readability while all it will matter in future is  model interpertability.Maybe it is time to put Code complete , Pragmmatic programmer to rest and time for next generation of thought leaders to emerge on how to work on . Though that future is still being invented. 

   This central thought(both short and long term) is what for me makes this an interesting advancement since for long the focus of tulip mania in the technology was around operational improvement ala cloud, dogmatic selling to enterprise of XML or technology without a product like DLT. After a long time there is  potenial disruptio on how development is done. 

## Uneven Impact and Adoption
As with any hype cycle there is no stratification in messaging by early adoptors on who and how the benefits are to be reaped. Harking back to when everyone was suppose to jump on to the microservice bandwagon.There is an understanble focus on code development which is the biggest single source of "perceived" activity a team is spending time on. There are quite a few of the adjacent cohorts or use cases that are either not getting enough signalling or genuniely not being so much worked on. The specialized vendors are definitely promulgating their product i.e. SalesForce, Slack etc but not so much in a fundamental way that I don't  heard you will not need a project manager vs developer jobs are going away in 5 years time predictions.  

### Enterprise Rebuilds
There seems to be less push on modernization of legacy enterpise software atleast the content and messaging I get served. On surface looks like a good fitment of technology.It atleast is very good at understanding the code chunks almost revese engineering the intent for human description and further refinement allowing a possibility of resistation of modernization debate as for a lot of these projects there is almost fragmented chains of incomplete narratives by way of documentation and intent  making rewrites daunting or impossible. This lack might be because of 
+ Not enough model training on languages like Perl, Fortran etc.
+ Ground truths like no original SME's or corectness/testing harnesses,social/professional risk of failure etc still somewhat exists. The provebial rewrite is always provebial, almost never due to lack of funds in enterprises
+ Fundamentally a backward looking problem,all new technology must promise to promogates the new world and this doesnot fit the narrative
+ Real world problem with sales cycles in enterprises

### Project Management
The other software specific problem I donot see people working up a fervour to replace are project managers. A good PM for most part after SME's/BA's are the biggest convertors of ground level qualtative uncertainty captured in disprate mails, messages and meetings into a common language and metrics time series.Of the complete scope atleast the first order activities of information synthesis and quantification is a good place to focus. Given the ability to synthesize and upcoming trends on MCP/Tooling this sounds relatively muted.Again few potenial reasons might be around
+ Anecdoteally fewer project managers per developer. Therefore a less lucrative target for automation as such
+ Difficult in places where the source data is fragmented across different mediums and a lot of it is oral and informal
+ Gen 1 of automation where message on chat --> update in SaaS seems to be most visible messaging from tool providers


Part 2 of this post will cover that
+ What are potenial impact on teams and work
+ The non developer and developer question
